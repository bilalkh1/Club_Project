                The history of French occupation in Africa during the last century is a complex and multifaceted story involving colonization, resistance, decolonization, and the lasting impacts of French influence in the region. Here is an overview of the key events and developments:

### Early 20th Century

#### Colonial Expansion
- **Late 19th to Early 20th Century**: France expanded its empire in Africa during the Scramble for Africa, acquiring vast territories. By the early 20th century, French West Africa (Afrique Occidentale Française, AOF) and French Equatorial Africa (Afrique Équatoriale Française, AEF) were established, comprising modern-day countries such as Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Niger, Chad, Central African Republic, and Gabon.

#### Administration and Exploitation
- The French colonial administration imposed systems of direct rule, exploiting local resources and labor. Indigenous populations were often subjected to harsh conditions, forced labor, and cultural assimilation policies, including the promotion of the French language and French cultural norms.

### Interwar Period (1918-1939)

#### Economic Exploitation and Social Changes
- The interwar period saw continued economic exploitation, with French colonies providing raw materials for the French economy. Infrastructure projects, such as railways and ports, were developed, often using forced labor.
- Social changes began to emerge, with the rise of educated African elites who started to question colonial rule and advocate for greater rights and autonomy.

### World War II (1939-1945)

#### Role in the War
- African colonies played a significant role in World War II, providing troops and resources for the French war effort. The Free French Forces, led by Charles de Gaulle, received support from African colonies after the fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940.

### Post-War Period and Decolonization (1945-1960)

#### Rise of Nationalism
- The post-war period saw a surge in nationalist movements across Africa. Educated elites, veterans, and labor unions began to demand independence and an end to colonial rule.
- The French government, under pressure both domestically and internationally, started to grant more political rights and representation to its African colonies.

#### Independence Movements
- **1950s-1960s**: The decolonization process accelerated, with many French African colonies gaining independence. Key milestones include:
  - **1956**: Morocco and Tunisia gained independence.
  - **1960**: The "Year of Africa," when 14 French colonies, including Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Niger, achieved independence.

### Post-Independence Period

#### Franco-African Relations
- Despite formal independence, France maintained strong political, economic, and military ties with its former colonies, a policy often referred to as "Françafrique." This relationship involved economic aid, military assistance, and political influence, sometimes supporting authoritarian regimes to maintain stability and protect French interests.

#### Economic and Political Challenges
- Newly independent states faced numerous challenges, including building stable political systems, developing economies, and addressing ethnic and regional conflicts. The legacy of colonial rule, such as arbitrary borders and underdeveloped infrastructure, complicated these efforts.

### Late 20th Century to Present

#### Continued Influence and Intervention
- France continued to intervene in African affairs, often justifying actions as maintaining stability or protecting French nationals. Notable interventions include military operations in Chad, Central African Republic, and Mali.
- Economic ties remain strong, with French companies having significant investments in African economies. The CFA franc, a currency used by several West and Central African countries, remains pegged to the euro, reflecting ongoing economic influence.

#### Contemporary Relations
- In recent years, there has been a growing push for a more balanced and equitable relationship between France and its former African colonies. Debates over the legacy of colonialism, economic dependency, and political sovereignty continue to shape Franco-African relations.

### Conclusion
The history of French occupation in Africa during the last century is marked by a transition from colonial domination to complex post-colonial relationships. The legacies of French rule, including cultural influences, economic ties, and political dynamics, continue to impact the region today.
